            <p class="text-white mb-6">Youth athletes pour their energy into practices and games, but measuring that growth shouldn't require advanced tools or manual stat tracking. We created GirlsNav to bring clarity and confidence to that process — so parents and players can focus on what matters: development, effort, and progress.</p>
